        <p>After attending the Data Privacy and Cyber Awareness Campaign and learning about data privacy and cybersecurity is helpful for the students of the University of Perpetual Help Molino, but as an IT student, I already knew some of the topic discussed during the presentation but what i learned in this presentation is how serious is data privacy and cybersecurity to the people who aren’t familiar in using modern technologies such as  phones, laptops, and computers for example, almost all the applications today is monitoring your device and collecting personal informations as it is written on the ‘terms & conditions’ but most people don’t read the it because it’s boring for them or simply they just need to use the application and the only way to access the application is to agree to the ‘terms & conditions’ of these applications. And the importance of data privacy will only continue to grow as the world progresses because everything about the modern world is connected to technology, and even the simplest jobs require familiarity with the technology.</p>
        <p>One of the things I've thought about is the importance of good data security since the responsibilities of the companies that monitor and collect data from your devices are to protect their users’s data, and that responsibility is not to be taken lightly as companies can face consequences if the data is stolen or leaked. This is why it's crucial for the companies to take security measures and make their users’s data secure. These are the impacts of data privacy laws, as they have raised awareness about the data protection of their users, and they also made these companies accountable for what will happen if the data they collected from their users is stolen or leaked. And if the user wants to be more secure about their data, they can take extra precautions in spending their time on the internet, for example, using incognito or using different accounts, just so they can be less vulnerable from their data breach.</p>
        <p>The campaign also changed my perspective about data privacy and cyber awareness, as most of the people using the internet without a care about their data being monitored and collected get caught at the convenience of staying all your accounts logged in at websites and applications that will result to the websites and applications knowing every move you make, so simple things such as logging your accounts out and clearing your browser data on your applications and websites can have a big impact on your data privacy, and this will make your data more secure in not more than a minute of work. This shows how a small change in your online behavior can have a big impact on your privacy, and doing so can help you build good habits in being more protective about your personal data in using modern technologies, which is very important because technology is constantly evolving and it will only continue to grow as the modern world is slowly becoming more and more digital with the accessibility of technology.</p>
